Personal-Website
This is a template that I designed for my personal website to showcase the things that I've built through the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. This is still in early development and is not the live version of the site. Pictures are still just place-holders (especially the picture of myself since I want to have a professional one taken.)

Design
The design of this website was inspired by films from the 1940's, in particular Casablanca. I really enjoyed playing with the absence of color until the user gets to particular parts. Active picture links are gray-scaled until there is a hover action. 

Portfolio Section
Was created to give room to different styles of pictures that can sit on one of two sections. Section 1 includes 1 row with three columns and fits a skinnier picture while the Section 2 includes 1 row with two columns. When the website is finalized the arrow on the bottom right of the pictures will be active and will serve as another UI hint that the user can visit a live deployed website/application.

In addition to the portfolio section, I included a resume template that showcases both my professional experience as well as education, skills, and interests.

HTML Page
The HMTL was put together with HTML Boilerplate. I added the template to my Sublime 3 editor as a snippet so that I can make pages on the fly much faster. All of the HTMl is commented in particular sections for easy editing. All href properties work and most images have dummy alt text. 

CSS
The css is a combination of bootstrap and various custom inputs. I wanted to make sure that users would feel comfortable when viewing the screen in various different widths and sizes. The bootstrap css was able to handle most resolutions down to 768px, which is where I included column breakpoints to make sure that the content was flowing through properly to smaller screens. I also included smooth scroll in the CSS and began experimenting with various different elements that I want to eventually incorporate into my finished design. Overall I think that this meets all of the requirements in the brief and really enjoyed putting it all together.

Images
All images either had rights purchased or taken by me with the exception of the portfolio section.
